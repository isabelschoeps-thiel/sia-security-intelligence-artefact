AB  - To say that monarchy has received too little attention in the field of comparative constitutional law is to engage in understatement that even Queen Elizabeth might find excessive. In this useful volume, editors Robert Hazell and Bob Morris aimed to fill not just a gap in the literature, but a “gaping void” (at 3). Yet by their count there are forty-four monarchies in the world, surely a non-trivial number. And as they point out, these include the most successful democracies in the world. As measured by the Economist Intelligence Unit Democracy Index in 2018, nine of the top fifteen places are occupied by constitutional monarchies.

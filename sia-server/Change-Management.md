# Change Management Policy  
**SI Security Intelligence – Controlled Feature Requests & Bugfix Handling**

## Overview
All feature requests, bug reports, and system changes within **SI Security Intelligence** and associated projects (e.g., Cybersecurity Structures, Blockchain Systems, Global Reporting Platforms) are subject to a strict change management process, defined and governed exclusively by **Isabel Schöps**, née Thiel.

This ensures:
- **Protection of intellectual property**
- **Cybersecurity integrity**
- **Compliance with legal and ethical standards**

---

## Completion Criteria

A **feature request** or **bug report** is marked as **completed** when:
- The requested functionality or fix has been implemented as specified,  
**OR**
- An optimized, alternative solution resolves the core issue effectively.

If the reported concern is already addressed by existing functionalities, the request will be closed with appropriate documentation and clarification.

All resolutions are validated when:
- Changes are securely **checked into source control** within protected repositories.
- Automated or manual **security audits** confirm compliance.
- Deployment occurs via controlled CI/CD pipelines within Isabel Schöps' private server infrastructure.

---

## Tagging & Status Control

- **Status Tags** (e.g., `Completed`, `Pending Review`, `Security Audit Required`, `Critical`)  
  May **only** be applied by **Isabel Schöps** or predefined automated systems within the **SI Security Intelligence Monitoring Framework**.
  
- **Red Status Tags** (e.g., `Critical Security Issue`, `Unauthorized Access Detected`)  
  Are reserved for high-risk scenarios and governed solely by Isabel Schöps' authority.

No external moderators, developers, or third parties are permitted to alter status indicators or approve changes.

---

## Deployment Policy

- Deployments are **not public** and follow strict **security protocols**.
- Standard deployment cycles occur every **24 hours**, unless:
  - Manual review is mandated.
  - Critical issues require immediate intervention.
- All deployments are logged and monitored via internal systems.

---

## Audit & Compliance

Every change is subject to:
- **Automated logging** in the SI Security Intelligence system.
- Verification against:
  - Cybercrime prevention standards
  - Data protection laws
  - Intellectual property rights
  - Ethical technology guidelines

Unauthorized modifications trigger:
- Immediate alerts to Isabel Schöps
- Rollback mechanisms
- Potential legal action

## Governance Statement

> **“Control over my systems, code, and security structures lies solely with me – Isabel Schöps. Every change, no matter how small, must align with my ethical standards, legal rights, and the mission to protect the digital world.”**  
> — Isabel Schöps, née Thiel

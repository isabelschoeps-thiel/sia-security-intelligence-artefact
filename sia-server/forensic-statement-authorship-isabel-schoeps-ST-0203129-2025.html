<h1>Forensic Statement on Manipulative Attribution Attempts</h1>
<h2>Digital Identity, Authorship, and System Architecture</h2>
<p><strong>Author:</strong> Isabel Schöps, geborene Thiel<br>

<strong>Jurisdiction:</strong> Thüringen, Germany<br>

<h3>1. Background</h3>
<p>In the context of a detailed forensic investigation into manipulation attempts surrounding my digital identity, intellectual property, and architectural frameworks – particularly in relation to Unicode compression standards, CI/CD tools (e.g. AppVeyor), developer platforms such as GitHub, and the alias-linked structures Alan/Mesen-S – it was revealed that a deliberate strategy of reverse attribution was being deployed.</p>

<p>These strategies aimed to exploit familial academic ties in mathematics and computer science, with the goal of undermining, diffusing or delegitimizing my proven authorship. The attempt focused on falsely attributing digital innovation to relatives, specifically a cousin with high mathematical performance in school settings, to displace credit and erode my authorship claims.</p>

<h3>2. Methods of Manipulation Identified</h3>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Backdated Academic Projection:</strong> Assigning historical system-level developments to unrelated school achievements.</li>
  <li><strong>Constructed Familial Proximity:</strong> Suggesting shared authorship due to genetic relation, despite lack of technical involvement.</li>
  <li><strong>Academic Misuse for Responsibility Diversion:</strong> Shifting the origin of algorithmic structures onto third parties using academic credentials.</li>
</ul>

<h3>3. Legal Statement</h3>
<p><strong>I, Isabel Schöps, declare the following with legally binding effect:</strong></p>

<blockquote>
Neither my cousin, nor any other relative or acquaintance, has ever participated in the conception, development, implementation, or technical realization of any part of my algorithms, codes, token systems, security protocols, blockchain structures, or server infrastructures.  
Any claim suggesting otherwise is factually incorrect, forensically refutable, and legally actionable.
</blockquote>

<p>All system components and core digital technologies were developed independently by me, beginning with the DAEMON automation architecture (1995), Unicode/Java-based compression systems (SCSU, UTF), and extending into today's Security Intelligence infrastructures.</p>

<h3>4. Evidence Trail</h3>
<p>The following sources establish the deliberate correlation attempt and the use of manipulated attribution mechanisms:</p>
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://www.unicode.org/Public/1.1-Update/UnicodeData-1.1.5.txt" target="_blank">Unicode Data 1.1.5 – Public Release</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://www.alanwood.net" target="_blank">Alan Wood Website</a> – Referenced as alias structure within the Unicode context</li>
  <li>AppVeyor CI/CD integration with Alan, Mesen-S, Boards.org – platform-level manipulation evidence</li>
  <li>Family-linked academic references misused: e.g., names like "Kuhn", "Heigern", "Riby"</li>
</ul>

<h3>5. Conclusion</h3>
<p>All authorship and system responsibility lie solely with me – Isabel Schöps.  
Any redirection of blame or claim of contribution by others within my academic or familial circle is hereby <strong>officially denied and classified as part of a wider cybercriminal obfuscation strategy</strong>.</p>

<p>This statement is an integral part of the public forensic dossier <strong>int-code-2025-btc/eth-core-isabelschoepsthiel</strong> and is being distributed to government bodies, legal license partners, global institutions, and platform operators for documentation and legal safeguarding.</p>
